# Task 4 – SQL for Data Analysis (Internship)

## 📌 Objective:
Analyze student performance data using SQL queries. This task demonstrates practical data extraction, aggregation, joining, and optimization techniques using structured queries on a relational database.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used:
- MySQL 8.x
- MySQL Workbench (for writing queries and viewing results)

---

## 🗃️ Database: `task4_db`

### Tables:
1. **`student`**  
   Contains student details: roll number, name, marks, grade, and city.

2. **`city_info`**  
   Contains mapping of cities to their respective states for join operations.

---

## 🔍 SQL Concepts Demonstrated:
- Basic Queries using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- Aggregate functions: `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
- `GROUP BY` for city-wise and grade-wise analysis
- `Subqueries` for comparing individual records to aggregated metrics
- `JOINS`: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN` (RIGHT JOIN noted)
- `CREATE VIEW` for high-performing students
- `CREATE INDEX` for performance optimization
- Handling NULL values using `COALESCE()`
